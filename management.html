    <h1>Management Team</h1>
    <p>
      The Management Team manages the chores that the students do at Base Camp.
      They make sure people are doing they're chores and gets with the
      procurement team for items that are required for chores. They also make
      sure everybody is doing they're work by documenting how much work the
      students have gotten done.
